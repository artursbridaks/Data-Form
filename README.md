###Instructions:

To run the project, open a local server in the terminal with the following command line: 
* php -S localhost:8000

To fill/ change the database information, open the 'database.php' file.
 
###Description:

The project has a simple form. After filling it, the data then is transferred to databases according to given data. 

If a client enters a sum above the "5000" mark, the program labels the client as an "A" client. Otherwise, as a "B" client.

By default, the status of the entry is set to "ask", but if it's changed to "offer", for visual purposes, the route "/send", 
simulates an action of sending an email to the selected entry email.

###Commentary:

Was following the instructions of the task the best of my current abilities. There definitely is a room for improvement.
